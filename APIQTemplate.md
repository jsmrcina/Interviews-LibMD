# Interview template
What is the primary goal?
How many users do we have (scale)? DAU and MAU measurements
What is our reliability and availability expectation?
Discuss use cases (stores)
What data is going in and what data is coming out?
Do we need to plan for integration points with other services?
Do we have any specific security or privacy concerns (auth, encryption, compliance)?
What will our logging and monitoring look like?

# API specific questions
What are the primary actions that this API will support?
Who will be consuming this API?
What does our typical workflow look like?
How will the API evolve over time (how will we handle versioning)?
Do we need to deal with concurrency or transactionality?
How do we deal with error states?

# Other thoughts
What is the plan for testing and monitoring?
Do we need to plan for extensibility points?
What will our documentation look like? 

# Specific design
Discuss what the class or service hierarchy might look like
    What are your interfaces
    What might your concrete classes be
    What helper functions might we want
